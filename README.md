# Testing asynchronous JavaScript
This repository contains a few tests that demonstrate some basics of testing asynchronous JavaScript.
You need Node and NPM to run these tests.
First, run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
Afterwards, read the tests, run `npm test`, and check whether you see anything that surprises you.
